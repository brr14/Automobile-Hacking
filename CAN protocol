CAN protocol
a) Controller Area Network most commonly used in automobile electronics.It was designed for rocust communication 
within the vehicle between micro-controllers and devices without the need of a host computer which makes the 
communication easier and efficient.
b) It works as a broadcast type of network. CAN runs over two wires, CAN high and CAN low. Due to the "noise" 
inherent in automobile systems, CAN uses differential signaling. This is where the protocol raises and lowers 
the voltage on the two wires to communicate. In both high speed and low speed CAN, signaling drives the high
wire towards 5v and the low wire towards 0v when transmitting a zero (0) but doesn't drive either wire when
sending a one (1). 

Types of CAN messages
a) Data Frame - used for data transmission, the data source node sends the data frame. They are of two types of 
data frames standard and extended. The standard has 11 identifier bits and the extended has 29 bits.
b) Remote Frame - used when the data destination node requests the data from the source.
c) Error Frame - has two different fields: error flags and error delimiter(indicates the end of error message).
d) Overload frame -  has two different fields:Overload flag and overload delimiter. 

The OBD (On Board Diagnostics) Connector
a) helps in reading the oon-board computers, it has 16 pins.
b) Provides access to the status of various vehicle subsystems and the ability to monitor engine and vehicle 
performance. It can also be used to check for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).

CAN Bus Packet Layout
a) Arbitration ID- This field is used to identify the message and its priority on the network. 
b)Identifier Extension - The Identifier Extension bit is used to differentiate between standard frames 
and extended frames. 
c) Data Length Code - The DLC field is 4 bits long and indicates the number of bytes in the data field of the
frame. It can specify anywhere from 0 to 8 bytes of data.
